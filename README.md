# Query-Flow_Hybrid-RAG-Assistant-with-FallBack-Mechanism
This project is a realization of creating a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines Gemini API, Hugging Face embeddings, Faiss vector search, and ElevenLabs TTS. It delivers accurate, voice-enabled answers through a sleek Streamlit interface, with DuckDuckGo fallback for unmatched queries.
